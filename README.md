# Github-Api-Visualisation-Project


My application allows the user to enter any github username into the searchbar. It displays details relating to this username and graphs two pie charts. 
The first pie-chart represents the size of the users' repositories. 
The second represents the languages the user uses and how much they use them in proportion to one another.
